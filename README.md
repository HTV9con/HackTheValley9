**Inspiration**

Have you ever been stuck in a dying conversation? You know, those really awkward moments where you don't know what to say next, and the other person's just as lost. Well, who hasn't? And that's why we came up with Banter Buddy, an AI-powered app that helps you get through the hard conversations.

We thought of the potential that AI has in bringing people together. Our team knew that with the right tools, we will be able to help people communicate better and connect much closer. Taking inspiration from the latest developments in natural language processing and machine learning, we set out to build an app to make a real difference in the lives of common people.

**Building Banter Buddy**

We built Banter Buddy using a bunch of technologies (which made us question our existence), which include:

- Used a VPS for website hosting.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript and NodeJS for an intuitive user interface.
- Used AssemblyAI for voice-to-text and speech recognition.
- Our biggest challenge was integrating the speech-to-text API with the sentiment analysis model, but after some trial and error, we got it working seamlessly.

**What We Learned**

Throughout this project, we learned a lot about the potential of AI to enhance human connection. We realized that even small interventions can make a big difference in how people communicate. We also learned that building a user-friendly interface is crucial for making complex technology accessible to everyone. For our future plans, we are very excited to continue working with and further developing the Banter Buddy application, seeing where it might be applied to use cases across customer service, education, and healthcare. We believe our app can actually make a difference in people's lives, so we're committed to creating the best there is.
